Wait a minute. Didn't I say there was no Part 04? Well, yes and no. This is supposed to be Part 03 - Part II lol. 

In Part 03 - Part I, you saw what someone could produce using outdated Javascript + HTML form submissions. For Part II, I'm going to let you all see what you can really do if you shift most of the content to use Javascript.

I'm not going to explain too much here. Explore my code and compare it to what you saw in Part 03 - Part I. We can discuss this during PLD just before your 1 week break.
